## Overview
The Deep Fake Image Classifier is a web application built with Streamlit that harnesses the power of advanced machine learning techniques to distinguish between authentic and deep fake images. Leveraging state-of-the-art models such as MTCNN for face detection and ResNet50 for image classification, this application offers users a robust toolset to combat the proliferation of manipulated visual content.

At its core, the application utilizes MTCNN, a deep learning-based face detection algorithm known for its accuracy and efficiency in detecting faces within images. Once faces are detected, the application employs ResNet50, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture, to analyze and classify the images based on learned features and patterns.

 It provides users with the ability to upload their own images for classification or select from a set of example images.

## Features
- Upload custom images for classification.
- Select from a set of example images for testing.
- Display classification results in real-time.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
